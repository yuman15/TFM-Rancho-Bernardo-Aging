## *Summary*
This R script processes the "RBS_HEALTHYAGING.txt" dataset to extract and organize the chronological age of individuals that are going to be used in the TFM.


```{r}
df <- read.table("RBS_HEALTHYAGING.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```


```{r}
tabla_age_m <- df %>%
  filter(SEX == "1") %>%
  select(SUBJID, VISIT, AGE, DEATHAGE) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = VISIT,
    values_from = AGE,
    names_prefix = "AGE_visit_"
  )
```

```{r}
tabla_age_f <- df %>%
  filter(SEX == "0") %>%
  select(SUBJID, VISIT, AGE, DEATHAGE) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = VISIT,
    values_from = AGE,
    names_prefix = "AGE_visit_"
  )

```


# *Age of the individuals that remained in the final databases (V7-V10)*

```{r}
db_male <- readRDS("db_male_final.rds")
subjid_unicos_m <- unique(db_male$SUBJID)

tabla_age_male <- tabla_age_m %>%
  filter(SUBJID %in% subjid_unicos_m)
```

```{r}
db_female <- readRDS("db_female_final.rds")
subjid_unicos_f <- unique(db_female$SUBJID)

tabla_age_female <- tabla_age_f %>%
  filter(SUBJID %in% subjid_unicos_f)
```


```{r}
write.csv(tabla_age_female, file = "tabla_age_female.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(tabla_age_male, file = "tabla_age_male.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
